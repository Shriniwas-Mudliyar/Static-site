# üåê Static Website Hosting on AWS (S3 + CloudFront)

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to host and deliver a static website using **Amazon S3** for storage and **Amazon CloudFront** as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
The goal was to deploy a fast, secure, and globally distributed portfolio website.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

* **Amazon S3** ‚Üí Stores static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, Images).
* **Amazon CloudFront** ‚Üí Distributes content globally with low latency.
* **Route 53 (optional)** ‚Üí For custom domain mapping.
* **IAM** ‚Üí For secure access and permissions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Deploy

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Configure S3 Bucket

* Created an **S3 bucket** named `shriniwas-profile`.
* Uploaded website files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `styles.css`, etc.).
* Set **bucket policy** to allow public read access for objects.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up CloudFront Distribution

* Created a **CloudFront distribution**.
* Set the **origin** to the S3 bucket.
* Configured **default root object** = `index.html`.
* Enabled **HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS redirection** for security.

## ‚úÖ Key Learnings

* Hosting static websites on **S3** is simple and cost-effective.
* **CloudFront** improves performance by caching content globally.
* Proper **IAM & bucket policies** ensure security.
* Learned how to automate deployments using the **AWS CLI**.

## üìå Next Improvements

* Add **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions + S3 + CloudFront.
* Integrate **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** for better security.
* Use **Terraform/CloudFormation** for Infrastructure as Code.
